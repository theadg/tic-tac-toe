# Tic Tac Toe

This is a solution to the [Project: Tic Tac Toe](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe). The [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about) provides a free open source coding curriculum that can be taken entirely online. Since its inception, it has helped many students get hired as developers and has assisted countless others in learning enough programming to work on their own personal projects.

## Overview

### The challenge

Build a Tic Tac Toe game that you can play in your browser.

- Has two modes, 2 players and AI
- Utilize modules and constructors in JS
- Have little global code as possible
- Allow users to put in their names

## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- BEM Naming Convention
- Vanilla JS
- SASS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I have understood the importance of using constructors and modules in JS. It gives us the to have more clean and more secure code because we can tuck in functions into modules. It also allows us the have a neater namespace, so we can call variables however we want to, with no problems. I was amazed by Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE). There were times I was asking myself why a certain block of code was running already and then when I inspected my code, I realized that it was an IIFE. Silly me.

### Continued development

I have a lot to learn how to better optimize my code, using best practices. I want to have more experience with the use of modules and constructors. I will definitely be applying my learnings from this project to my upcoming ones. Also, I would like to learn about JS naming conventions so that my naming conventions wouldn't be all over the place.
